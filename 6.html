    <h1>BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p><b>A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or
       public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been
       executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction 
       in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the
       participants in the system. And, once entered, information can never
       be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record 
       of every single transaction ever made. To use a basic analogy, it is
       easy to steal a cookie from a cookie jar, kept in a secluded place 
       than stealing the cookie from a cookie jar kept in a market place, 
       being observed by thousands of people.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin is the most popular example that is intrinsically tied to blockchain 
        technology. It is also the most controversial one since it helps to enable a
        multibillion-dollar global market of anonymous transactions without any 
        governmental control. Hence it has to deal with a number of regulatory issues
        involving national governments and financial institutions. However, Blockchain
        technology itself is non-controversial and has worked flawlessly over the years
        and is being successfully applied to both financial and non-financial world 
        applications. </b></p>
